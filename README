FRC TEAM 2879 robot code

Version Unknown - Xbox controller?


Interesting quotes from development:
--------------------------------------------------
Gregory: "Make the computer thingy"


HARDWARE CONFIGURATION
--------------------------------------------------
WARNING: The Talons do have their own class, seperate from "jags." However, this class is not implimented yet. In order to use Talons with the Jaguar class, you may need to calibrate the Talons to use the Jaguar PWM conventions.

NOTE: The shooter motors may be controlled as a pair with only one controller if needed. It would use the "shooter motor #1" talon on Sidecar PWM port #4

Device:                          Connection:
--------------------------------------------------
(jag(talon))  Right drive motor   (Sidecar) PWM port #1 
(jag(talon))  Left  drive motor   (Sidecar) PWM port #2
(jag(talon))  Frisbee Feed motor  (Sidecar) PWM port #3
(jag(talon))  shooter motor #1    (Sidecar) PWM port #4
(jag(talon))  shooter motor #2    (Sidecar) PWM port #5 
(spike) Compressor                (Sidecar) Relay port #1
Digital Pressure Sensor           (Sidecar) Digital Input Port #1
~~ Solenoid valve will be added here when we know what kind it is, and when we find our solenoid breakout board ~~ 
USB Xbox controller               (Laptop)  USB port #1 (Usin it for real now. This code will not work with a standard joystick)
